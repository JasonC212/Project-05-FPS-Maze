# Project-05-FPS-Maze

Mazer is a melancholy maze game build with procedural generation. You walk around mines, collet orbs and a key, and try to escape via a portal. 

When you are at any scene, wait for the music. It takes just a little bit of time to start. 

You can literally walk around the mines, they will only explode if you are right on top of them. The map may be a little large so you can go into godot to change the camera from the player to the one I have in the Maze scene (just don't move the mouse, the game is top down but the character will still rotate around the mouse which makes it awkward to control. 

Key is in the top right when viewed from overhead. portal is bottom left. they are both a green color.

###EXTRA

Maze is built with procedural generation

orbs are placed within the maze for player to collect to increase score. They have sound when picked up and lighting. 

Mines are all over the map and have 3d partical animation made by me and have sound. They explode and damage the players health

Player has health bar and status about if he has the key ("No key", or "Got the Key")

Font changed. 

Music for Maze, Intro, Win, and Lose senarios. 

All 3d assest where made in godot (Key was made by me, portal was made by me, Mines were made by me, etc.)

Shaders used for Win and lost scenes.
